## Launch of personal github pages

While digging around comparing options to set up some form of electronic lab notebook, the necessity for version control coupled with the ease of direct incorporation of project management led me to github pages, which in turn led me to realize the possibility of utilizing it as a new home for my old Wordpress site. With some experimentation it now looks likely that I will retire the site of my college years and migrate all content here instead. 

Some key factors in this decision:

* Ease of updates and integration with workflow (after familiarity with Git)
* Simple markdown formatting/direct accessibility (wordpress is great with customization, but at the cost of time spent on navigating its structural complexity) 
* Static Sites! (Surprised at how ignorant I was of them before, considering their speed, scalability, and straight-forwardness)
* Relief from the data limits and other restrictions of shared hosting. 

That is not to say that Wordpress is inferior in performance - it is still decidely the king of dynamic websites and blogs and offers significant advantages of its own. I had a fun relationship with Wordpress and would likely still return to it if needed, but for the purposes of a personal profile/blog/work documentation kind of site, a simple, flat-file sort of content organization would be more than useful, and sufficient. 

And admittedly, I'm starting to develop a fondness for github repos.

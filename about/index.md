### Under construction

This is an amalgamation of my (now retired) personal wordpress site and a planned new academic website. It is currently still being built and tweaked, but feel free to browse. 

## About me

I am currently a graduate student studying infectious disease epidemiology in the Harvard Chan School. I work at the

in the lab of 
<div markdown="0"><a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/william-hanage/" class="btn">Prof. Bill Hanage</a></div>, where we focus on . You can find our lab blog (with front-line research snippits and bioinformatic tips) <div markdown="0"><a href="https://c2-d2.github.io/hanage-lab/" class="btn"> here </a></div> . I recieved my BSc from Taipei Medical University, during which time I worked on murine models of molecular hepatitis B evolution under the guidance of Prof. Hung-Yi at the National Taiwan University Graduate institute of clinical medicine. I am fascinated by the underlying dynamics that shape the genomic structure and evolutionary trajectories of microbial populations, and enjoy exploring topics pertaining to biological complexity or ecological interactions using both experimental and computational methods. More information can be found in research or cv/resume. 


## Skills and domains



## Bio
As a child of a military pilot, I was born in Taiwan and grew up moving from base to base across the globe; this resulted in a very confusing thrid culture childhood that laid the path to becoming a professional in being confused. 


## What's up with the logo?
In my brief marriage with wordpress under an anonymous blog, a friend jokingly pasted an icon of a 'bibliophilic animal virus with a icosahedral nucleocapsid and a modified bilayer hoodie' onto the old site, and the small sketch is one of few things that migrated with me here.

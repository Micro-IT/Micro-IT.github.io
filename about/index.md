### Under construction

Welcome to my site! This is an amalgamation of my (now retired) personal wordpress site and a planned new academic website. It is currently still being built and tweaked, but feel free to browse around. 

## About me

I am currently a graduate student studying infectious disease epidemiology in the Harvard Chan School in Boston, MA. I also work as a research assistant at the [Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics](https://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/) in the lab of [Prof. Bill Hanage](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/william-hanage/) , where we analyze the evolutionary dynamics and population genetics of pathogenic microbes to inform and develop tools for infectious disease research. You can find our [lab blog (with interesting updates and bioinformatic tips here](https://c2-d2.github.io/hanage-lab/) . I recieved my BSc from Taipei Medical University, during which time I worked on dengue surveillance and murine models of molecular hepatitis B evolution under the guidance of [Prof. Hurng-Yi Wang](https://hurngyi.wixsite.com/hurngyi-1) at the National Taiwan University Graduate institute of clinical medicine. My research interests are focused on the underlying dynamics that shape the genomic structure and evolutionary trajectories of microbial populations, and I enjoy exploring topics pertaining to biological complexity or ecological interactions using both experimental and computational methods.
